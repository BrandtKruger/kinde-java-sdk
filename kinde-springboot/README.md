# Spring Boot SDK Library

Welcome to the Spring Boot SDK Library!

## Overview

This library is currently under active development. At present, it only supports PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) authentication through Spring Boot. Authorization and access to feature flags are not yet supported, but don't worryâ€”we're actively working on these features and will announce them as soon as they are ready.

## PKCE Authentication

PKCE authentication is a crucial part of securing OAuth 2.0 flows, and our library currently provides robust support for it. If you need to implement PKCE authentication in your Spring Boot application, this library is here to help.

## Future Features

- **Authorization**: We plan to add comprehensive support for authorization soon.
- **Feature Flags**: Access to feature flags through Spring Boot will also be available in upcoming updates.

## Examples

While we continue to build out these features, we encourage you to explore our PKCE example in the playground. It offers a practical demonstration of how to implement PKCE authentication with our library.
